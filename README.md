This repository contains implementations of RTOS concepts that I'm learning from Shawn Hymel's RTOS course "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F321087yYy4&list=PLEBQazB0HUyQ4hAPU1cJED6t3DU0h34bz".
This repo is purely for learning/educational purposes and will contain solutions to "Challenges" that Shawn brings up, throughout the course.
